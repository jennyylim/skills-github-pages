## 👋 About Me

I’m an adaptable professional transitioning into **Cloud Support & DevOps**. I’m currently building hands-on skills through the **Generation Cloud Support & DevOps programme**, learning Linux, networking basics, cloud fundamentals, and scripting.

I enjoy troubleshooting, documenting processes clearly, and improving workflows. I’m looking for opportunities where I can support systems, learn fast, and grow into a Cloud/DevOps role.
